# name-classification
simple demo for name-nationality classification with kmeans and hierarchical clustering
# About
Two datasets provided, **"processed_data"** was derived from fifa players dataset with name and nationality extracted, **"name-define"** was artificially created just for demo
<br/>
*It seems that no public dataset can be found with information of name-nationality, but census dataset is very comprehensive with name-ethnicity information, which could be proper to do this, since the crucial difference between human names is actually about ethnicity but not nationality considering the immigration possibility*
<br/>
<br/>
Hierarchical clustering is also implemented in the last part, as a comparison to k-means clustering, with both cosine and euclidean distance included
